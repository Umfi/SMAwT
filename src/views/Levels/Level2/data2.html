    <h1>Privacy</h1>


    <p class="lead">
      When you post something online you often have the posibility to limit who actually can see your posts.
      <br>
      This is great, because you can decide who can see your posts and who not. 
      <br>
      Most social networks have a privacy setting where you can decide who can see your posts.
